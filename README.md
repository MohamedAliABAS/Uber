I conducted an analysis of Uber’s bookings in the year 2024, with the aim of knowing the performance of the service and the behavior of customers and drivers.
1 - Cards (general performance summary):
Total Booking = 150K
This means 150 thousand trips were made during the year.
Total Booking Completed = 93K
This means that about 62% of the trips were actually completed.
AVG CTAT = 29.15
The average time it takes a customer from the time of booking until the flight begins.
AVG VTAT = 8.46
This is the actual average flight time (delivery time).
AVG Customer Rating = 4.40
Customer evaluation of the service is excellent, and this is a very strong indicator of satisfaction. 🌟
2- The Line Chart:
It shows the change in the number of flights and their status each month (January → December).
You can see that the number of trips is relatively constant, with a balance between the different cases (Complete - Canceled - Incomplete - No driver found).
3- The Pie Chart explains the payment method:
45% of customers pay via UPI
25% Cash
The rest is between Uber Wallet, Credit, and Debit Card
This gives me an idea about customers' payment preferences.
4- The Tree Chart shows the reasons why customers canceled the trip:
Driver is not moving
Wrong Address
Change of plans
AC not working
This means that most of the cancellations were for reasons related to the driver or address.
5- The Bar Chart shows the types of cars that customers order the most:
The most frequently used type is Auto (37K)
Followed by Go Mini (30K) and Go Sedan (27K)
The lowest is Uber XL (4K)
This shows that customers prefer more economical trips.
6- The Column Chart shows the number of flight cases:
93K trips completed
27K was removed from the driver
11K canceled from the customer
The rest is due to “No Driver Found” or “Incomplete”
7- 🎯Final result:
From this analysis we can conclude that:
The completion rate for trips is good, but we need to reduce driver cancellations.
Customers are satisfied (Rating 4.4).
Most orders are placed on economic vehicles.
Digital payment methods (UPI) have become the most widely used.
